## System requirements
- 2.4 GHz CPU or faster (multi-core recommended)
- Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11
- Graphics card with OpenGL 3.2 support

### Required software on Windows
- [Microsoft .Net Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)

## Building on Linux

__Note:__ this is experimental. None of the main developers are using Linux as a desktop OS, so you're pretty much on your own if you encounter any problems with running the application.

### Manual build

These instructions are for Debian-based distros and were tested with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Arch.

- Install Mono
  - **Ubuntu:** The `mono-complete` package from the Debian repo doesn't include `msbuild`, so you have to install `mono-complete` by following the instructions on the Mono project's website: https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin
  - **Arch:** mono (and msbuild which is also required) is in the *extra/* repo, which is enabled by default. `sudo pacman -S mono mono-msbuild`
- Install additional required packages
  - **Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install make g++ git libx11-dev libxfixes-dev mesa-common-dev`
  - **Arch:** `sudo pacman -S base-devel`
    - If you're using X11 display manager you may need to install these packages: `libx11 libxfixes`
    - If you are not using the proprietary nvidia driver you may need to install `mesa`
- Go to a directory of your choice and clone the repository (it'll automatically create an `UltimateDoomBuilder` directory in the current directory): `git clone https://github.com/UltimateDoomBuilder/UltimateDoomBuilder.git`
- Compile UDB: `cd UltimateDoomBuilder && make`
- Run UDB: `cd Build && ./builder`
- Alternatively, to compile UDB in debug mode:
  - Run `make BUILDTYPE=Debug` in the root project directory
  - This includes a debug output terminal in the bottom panel

### Flatpak build

The advantage of using Flatpak to build a package is that you do not need to install Mono directly into your system, since everything in the build process will be self-contained. This also means that this works on Linux distributions that do not have `msbuild` in their repository.

- To build UDB using Flatpak you need both **Flatpak** and **Flatpak Builder**. How they are installed depends on your distribution. For example on Debian-based distributions they can be installed using `sudo apt install flatpak flatpak-builder`. Check your distro's documentation for information on how to install them.
- Go to a directory of your choice and clone the repository (it'll automatically create an UltimateDoomBuilder directory in the current directory):
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/UltimateDoomBuilder/UltimateDoomBuilder.git
  ``` 
- Go to the cloned directory:
  ```
  cd UltimateDoomBuilder
  ```

- Build the Flatpak. This will also download all required dependencies:
  ```
  ./build_flatpak.sh
  ```

- This will create a file in the format `ultimatedoombuilder-<version>.flatpak` in the `Releases` directory. You can now install and run the Flatpak:

  ```
  flatpak install --user Releases/ultimatedoombuilder-<version>.flatpak
  flatpak run io.github.ultimatedoombuilder.ultimatedoombuilder
  ```
### Flatpak build using WSL2

You can also build the flatpak on Windows using WSL2.

#### Initial setup
- Create the instance. Requires entering a user name and password:
  ```powershell
  wsl --install Ubuntu-24.04 --name udb-flatpak-builder
  ```
- Install required Flatpak packages and clone the repository, then exit the insance. Requires entering the user password from the previous step:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install flatpak flatpak-builder
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/UltimateDoomBuilder/UltimateDoomBuilder.git
  exit
  ```

#### Building the flatpak
- Update the repository and build the flatpak:
  ```powershell
  wsl --distribution udb-flatpak-builder --cd ~/UltimateDoomBuilder -- git pull `&`& ./build_flatpak.sh
  ```
- Get the flatpak from the UNC path `\\wsl.localhost\udb-flatpak-builder\home\$env:username\UltimateDoomBuilder\Releases`.
- Stop the instance (optional, it should shut itself down after some time):
  ```powershell
  wsl --terminate udb-flatpak-builder
  ```

## About dofBuilder
dofBuilder is a visual overhaul of UltimateDoomBuilder. It essentially works just as UltimateDoomBuilder but with updated icons and UI.

We use dofBuilder for Project: AMICA.
